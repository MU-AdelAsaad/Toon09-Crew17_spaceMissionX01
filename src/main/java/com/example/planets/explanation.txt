Model is an interface to make implementing future models with the different methods eassier

each model for a diff. eq. we want implements Model


with Eulers you can calculate steps with either first or second degree depending on the degree model,
you must input the size of the dx and the model and all the values will be updated automatically for next
step

the value of y is a return of the step but also updates it in the instance of model so it can be accesed from there


the models simple1 and simple2 are just demonstrations on how to implement models, simple1 is a diff. eq. of degree 1,
simple2 is a diff. eq. of degree 2 but i was too lazy to finish writing bc i wanna sleep :P
